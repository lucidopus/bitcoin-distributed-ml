# Utility Scripts

This folder contains helper scripts that support our main analytical workflows.

## File Descriptions

- **`generate_plots.py`**: An essential post-processing script. It reads the raw metrics from `evaluation/results.json` and generates the clean, comparative plots found in the visualizations folder. It handles the logic for visualizing "Time vs. Workers," "Accuracy vs. Data Split," and other key metrics.
