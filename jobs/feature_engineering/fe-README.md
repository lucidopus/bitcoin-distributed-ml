# Feature Engineering Scripts

This folder contains the logic for creating predictive features from our raw data.

## File Descriptions

- **`feature-engineering.py`**: The primary script for our feature engineering phase. It calculates complex indicators like Garman-Klass volatility, lagged returns, and other technical signals that drive our models.
- **`feature_engineering_lr.py`**: A specialized version of the feature engineering process, likely tailored with specific features or transformations optimized for our Logistic Regression experiments.
