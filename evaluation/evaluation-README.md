# Evaluation Results

This directory is the destination for the analytical output of our machine learning models.

## File Descriptions

- **`results.json`**: This JSON file is arguably the most critical log in our experiment. It aggregates the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time) for every model run, across different configurations (like worker counts and data splits). It serves as the raw data source for our visualization scripts.
